Everyone hears about the truly scary monsters who stir up trouble, rampage villages, and generally cause problems. But what about the monsters with problems of their own?

Have you ever tried to strike fear into the soul of local farmers whilst battling a crippling fear of cows? Well, Mildred the Agitated does, and bovinophobia effects not only her quality of life but also her ability to do her job.

Ever tried to whisper mutinous thoughts into the ears of the local militia whilst battling crippling agrophobia? No? Well, Yves the Fearful hasn't been able to stir up even a minor resentment amongst the soldiers, and frankly, it's really been getting him down! Poor guy can barely manage to mutter a creepy prophetic word at locals walking through the forest at night.

This site is dedicated to fostering empathy for the worried monsters. The nervous ones who bravely face their fears so that they, in turn, can terrify their local communities as nature would have it.

Monsters have worries too!
